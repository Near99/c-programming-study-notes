## Pre-study the C programming language for implementing data structures.

## Learning resources

1. The best Youtube channel on C pointers I've found so far is [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool/featured).

2. I use ***C Primer Plus (6th Edition)*** as the reference book over the classic ***The C Programming Language***.
