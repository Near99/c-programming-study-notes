## Pre-study the C programming language for implementing data structures.

## Learning resources

1. The best Youtube channel on C pointers I've found so far is [Pointers in C/C++ by mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-HBipu_1P0&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_).

2. I use ***C Primer Plus (6th Edition)*** as the reference book over the classic ***The C Programming Language***.

3. I would recommend anyone who's not all that passionate about and interested in C learn C++ instead.
